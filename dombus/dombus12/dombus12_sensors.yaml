# Creasol DomBus12: small board with 9 general purpose I/Os, 2 of which are configured by default as open-drain output to drive relay coils or LEDs (100mA max)
# IO3 configured as analog value connected to an external 10k 3950 NTC temperature sensor: this sensor return the analog voltage, that will be transformed by a math operation
# Please configure IO3 (register 256+2=258) to 8 (IN_ANALOG)!
