# Using Creasol DomBus modules with Home Assistant
DomBus modules can be supplied with two firmwares: please choose *Modbus firmware* if you intend to use it with Home Assistant.

In this repository, for each module a directory is created within the configuration files to use DomBus modules equipped with Modbus firmware with Home Assistant.

**It's recommended to use DomBus firmware + DomBusGateway software, that provides a DomBus 2 MQTT-AutoDiscovery interface. Please check https://github.com/CreasolTech/DomBusGateway**

Files are:
* **configuration.yaml** that includes **dombus1.yaml** with all entities for DomBus modules connected to the same bus, and some helpers.
* **dombus1.yaml** contains the configuration of Modbus #1 (you can have more buses, each for one serial port)
* **dombusXXXX.yaml** contains entities for specific DomBus modules connected to this bus

Any Modbus RTU bus can store up to 247 modules, but for large domotic networks with 20 or more modules, it's better to divide the network in more buses (one bus for each floor, for example): in this case it's possible to include in *configuration.yaml* the file *dombus2.yaml* for bus #2, and so on.
																																															  Please note that for each entity type there is a included file: in this way it's easier to enable/disable configuration file for each module ( EVSE module, relay modules, ... )

In case that an energy meter to measure the grid power already exists, you don't need to install another energy meter: just use a simple automation to feed the current power from the grid (negative if power is exported to the grid) to the EVSE module, as shown in the following picture (check file *dombus/dombusevse/dombusevse_automations.yaml*)

## DomBus36 
DomBus36 is a **high efficiency  module with 12 relay outputs**, grouped in 3 groups to have an easier wiring: each group share the same common, so you **don't need to make jumpers to connect the common wire (Line, Neutral, Ground or +12/24V) to all relays**.

Relays are protected from overvoltage and overcurrent, and module has a **very low power consumption: less than 15mW with all relays OFF, and less than 750mW when all 12 relays are ON**. Can you compare this power consumption with other modules in the market?

## Creasol DomBus modules

Below a list of modules, produced in Italy by Creasol, designed for high reliability and optimized for very very low power consumption.

Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power &rArr; **10÷15mW with relays OFF**
* reliable &rArr; **no disconnections**
* wired network (bus) &rArr; **no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**

Modules are available in two versions:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, suitable for every type of DomBus modules, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) by using the Creasol DomBus plugin, and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) ... by using the [DomBusGateway software, a DomBus 2 MQTT-AutoDiscovery interface](https://www.creasol.it/DomBusGateway)
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, suitable for relays modules, EVSE and Dual Axis solar tracker, working with almost any building automation system supporting Modbus

What version is the best? DomBus version, because:

**Modbus** is a standard protocol Master/Slave: the controller must poll each module to get its status, so it's **not suitable to manage inputs and counters that change frequently**, but can be used to manage relay outputs or read inputs status every 2-5s

**DomBus** is a proprietary multi-master protocol where **each module is able to initiate the communication with the master** to notify, for example, an input change, with a short latency (<100ms) that permits to **manage alarm sensors in a reliable way**. Also, DomBus supports the so-called DCMD, **commands exchanged between modules as KNX does**, so it's possible to program simple automations that work between modules even if the domotic controller is OFF (for example, short pulse on button to toggle a light ON/OFF, 1s pulse to open the garage door, 2s pulse to turn OFF some lights, ...)

### DomBusEVSE - EVSE module to build a Smart Wallbox / EV charging station
<a href="https://store.creasol.it/DomBusEVSE"><img src="https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_plug_300.webp" alt="DomBusEVSE smart EVSE module to make a Smart Wallbox EV Charging station" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" align="left" /></a>
Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* **Single-phase and three-phase**, up to 32A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes: in this case **the EVSE module can drain ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100% **minimizing the charge time and increasing the charging efficiency**.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work in *managed mode*, with an automation in the home automation system setting the charging current**
